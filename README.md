Diagram Printer Refactoring Kata - With Tests
=============================================

This exercise was inspired by some production code I saw once. This version of it has unit tests that will support you as you refactor to improve the design.

The rest of the system, (which you need to imagine because it's not included here), calls the public methods on the 'DiagramPrinter' class. You should not change the signature of these public methods. You should try not to change any code that is marked as not being possible to call from a unit test.

Exercise Instructions
---------------------

Improve the design of the code in 'DiagramPrinter' and 'DiagramPhysicalPrinter' without breaking the unit tests.

Unit testing challenge
----------------------

This repository has a sister version [DiagramPrinter-TestDesign-Kata]() which is the same code but without unit tests. This repo is a 'sample solution' to that one. If you're interested in techniques for getting difficult code under test, try that one.
